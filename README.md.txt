## Setting Up GitHub Pages for Preview

1.  **Push to GitHub:**
    * Initialize a git repository if you haven't already: `git init`
    * Add all files: `git add .`
    * Commit the files: `git commit -m "Initial website structure"`
    * Create a new repository on GitHub.
    * Add the remote: `git remote add origin [Your Repository URL]`
    * Push to the main branch: `git push -u origin main` (or `master` depending on your default)

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings".
    * Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
    * Under "Source," select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the `/ (root)` folder.
    * Click "Save."
    * GitHub will provide you with a URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/`) where your site will be live. It might take a few minutes to deploy.

## Further Tuning & Development

This core structure is ready for you to expand upon:

1.  **Content Population:**
    * Fill in all placeholder text and sections in the HTML files using your complete content.
    * Add actual project details, product information, blog posts, and career openings.

2.  **CSS Styling:**
    * Expand `css/style.css` to fully style all pages and elements.
    * Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the site looks good on all devices.
    * Refine the layout to match your preferences (e.g., similar to `hcel-bd.com`, `reverie-bd.com`).

3.  **JavaScript Interactivity:**
    * Implement image sliders/carousels in `js/script.js` for the homepage and other relevant pages.
    * Add form validation for the contact form.
    * Consider JavaScript for any dynamic content filtering (e.g., for projects).

4.  **Image Integration:**
    * Replace placeholder image comments with actual `<img>` tags.
    * Optimize images for the web.

5.  **Dynamic Data Counts:**
    * For the "light database" counts (number of projects, capacity, etc.), you can:
        * **Simple (Static update):** Manually update these numbers in the HTML as they change.
        * **Intermediate (JS + JSON):** Store counts in a JSON file (e.g., `data/counts.json`) and use JavaScript (`fetch` API) to load and display them. You'd update the JSON file.
        * **Advanced:** For more complex needs, consider a headless CMS or a simple backend.

6.  **Contact Form Backend:**
    * HTML forms on static sites need a backend service to process submissions. Consider services like:
        * Formspree
        * Netlify Forms (if you host on Netlify)
        * Other third-party form handlers.

7.  **SEO & Accessibility:**
    * Add appropriate meta tags (description, keywords) to each HTML page.
    * Ensure semantic HTML is used.
    * Add `alt` text for all images.
    * Test for accessibility.
